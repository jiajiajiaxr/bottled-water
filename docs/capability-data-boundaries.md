# Capability And Data Boundaries

AgentHub exposes powerful capabilities through agents, tools, skills, MCP servers, sandbox commands, and external coding agents. This document defines the current boundaries.

## Permission Model

Agents can be configured with explicit permissions for:

- Built-in tools
- Custom tools
- Skills
- MCP tools
- Model configuration

When an agent uses default full permissions, backend execution and context summaries should agree on the effective tool list. Explicitly empty tool permissions stay empty.

## Tool Calls

Tool calls must pass:

- Agent authorization
- Tool availability
- Input schema validation
- Runtime safety checks

Successful and failed tool calls should be recorded through invocation records. User-facing claims about files, artifacts, deployment, external agents, or tests should be grounded in those records.

## Files And Workspaces

Workspace file operations must remain inside workspace-safe paths. File upload, read, write, preview, move, rename, and delete operations belong to backend file services. Frontend paths are display values, not authority.

## Sandbox

The local sandbox has command, cwd, timeout, and output controls. It is useful for development and demo execution. Production-grade process/container isolation is a deployment-infrastructure responsibility and remains a roadmap boundary.

## External Coding Agents

Codex and Claude Code adapters must:

- Probe runtime availability.
- Restrict cwd to safe workspace paths.
- Persist run status and output.
- Support cancel/status checks.
- Redact resolved command paths in user-facing probe payloads where appropriate.

They should never be treated as successful unless the run record says so.

## MCP

MCP invocation depends on registered server configuration and transport availability. Probe and invocation failures should return explicit degraded/failure results, not fake successful responses.

## Secrets

Secrets belong in backend environment/configuration or database provider records:

- Model provider keys
- JWT secret
- Database credentials
- External runtime credentials

Frontend code and frontend environment values must not contain real provider secrets.

## Conversation And Context Data

Context builders can include:

- Current conversation history
- Current workspace context
- Attachments and extracted text
- Tool results
- Workflow variables
- Shared blackboard facts
- Current agent private context

Context must not include unrelated conversation history unless explicitly intended through workspace memory or user-selected context.

## Deployment Preview

Deployment preview records are local/demo deployment facts. They can prove that an artifact preview URL was created and health-checked. They are not proof of production cloud deployment unless a production runtime is explicitly implemented.
